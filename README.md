#Getting and cleaning data
##For creating a tidy data set of wearable computing data originally from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

#Files in this repo

*README.md -- you are reading it right now
*CodeBook.md -- codebook describing variables, the data and transformations
*run_analysis.R -- actual R code

# Goals of the project
##Created an R Script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
